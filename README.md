## ‚ö†Ô∏è Avoid Conflicts (Syncing your fork)

An easy way to avoid conflicts is to add an 'upstream' for your git repo, as other PRs may be merged while you're working on your branch/fork.   

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/fineanmol/Hacktoberfest2024
```

You can verify that the new remote has been added by typing:

```bash
git remote -v
```

To pull any new changes from your parent repo, simply run:

```bash
git merge upstream/master
```

This will give you any eventual conflicts and allow you to easily solve them in your repo. It's a good idea to use it frequently in between your own commits to make sure that your repo is up to date with its parent.

For more information on syncing forks, [read this article from GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/).
