## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages: pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

## Installation


Clone the repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Asim-Sidd02/RiskPredectionSystem.git
cd RiskPredectionSystem
```

Install the dependencies using pip:

```sh
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## File Structure

The project directory structure is organized as follows:


- **`modelBuilding.py`**: Python script responsible for preprocessing the data, training a Random Forest Classifier, and evaluating its performance.
  
- **`main.py`**: Python script responsible for generating a PDF report (`ML_Model_Report.pdf`) with model performance metrics and visualizations.
  
- **`german_credit_data.csv`**: Dataset file used for training the machine learning model.

- **`ML_Model_Report.pdf`**: PDF report generated by `main.py` containing visualizations and metrics of the trained model.
